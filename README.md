<h1>Construction, Sales & Safety Suite</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project is a responive web application designed to streamline the workflow between site safety compliance, equipment rental management, and the sales estimation process.


<h2>The "Why" Behind This Project</h2>
I chose to build this specific suite because of my background in Construction, Sales, and Health & Safety (H&S). While I do not claim to be an expert in these fields, my hands-on experience gave me a front-row seat to the common communication gaps that happen between the office and the field.


I am using my industry knowledge to ensure this tool solves real-world problems:  
Safety: Prioritizing high-visibility "Safety First" layouts for mobile-using foremen.  
Sales: Integrating quick calculation tools to help reps provide faster, more accurate quotes.  
Construction: Organizing inventory in a way that reflects actual on-site equipment tracking needs.


<h1>🛠️ Current Tech Stack & Skills:</h1>  
Learning Path:  Currently completing the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.  
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid).  
Goal: To evolve this into a full-stack application as I progress through my JavaScript and Backend certifications.
